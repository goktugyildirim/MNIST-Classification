# MNIST-Classification
The main goal of this project is to show power of the CNNs. 
I trained CNN and ANN networks on MNIST. Then at the last epoch, I got the output of the pre-trained CNNs to use with k-Means. 
It provides a good mapping between clusters and class. This is the power of CNN.
Please check over my presentation. 
If you want to run my code please download traditional MNIST train and test CSV files.
